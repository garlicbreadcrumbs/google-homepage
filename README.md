A recreation of Google's homepage for The Odin Project.

I utilized HTML and CSS to the best of my current abilities and understanding of the languages to recreate the Google homepage.

It was a great project to get more familiar with syntax, but at the moment I am still trying to wrap my head around:

- Nesting
- Inheritance
- Positioning elements
- Flexbox/Grid
- CSS Units
- Responsive Web Design

Although, I might be too early into the learning process to really have a good understanding of the above.

I did learn about using external resources, like Google's material icons, and using an external style sheet.

If there was one thing I wish I had done differently, it would be to focus on laying out the main HTML elements and structure before diving into the CSS. I ended up jumping back and forth between the two a lot during this project. I'm sure there is a lot of extraneous code and redundancies in my project!

Overall, I really enjoyed the time I spent making this.
